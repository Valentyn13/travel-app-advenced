## NOTES

Link to deployment on vercel: https://travel-app-advenced.vercel.app/

In the previous task you said that I partially made one task from Trip Page:

*  "should not submit modal when date is not in the future" - by default I made that when the page loaded date is already in the future(always tomorrow's date). Also when the user try to select date before tomorrow's date is automatically sets like tomorrows date. So user can't select date not in the future and task is complete. Also all images in trip list now have the same height.
